VCS Emulator (DOS)

Built with [Turbo C 2.01](http://cc.embarcadero.com/item/25636) running on [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com).

In its current form, it partially emulates a headless [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCS) which can only boot standard 4K ROMs and then simply output every instruction being fetched. Still no RIOT, TIA, illegal 6507 instructions or custom cartridges. In other words, it does not play any games yet.
